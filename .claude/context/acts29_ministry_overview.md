# Acts 29 Church for the Unsheltered - Ministry Overview

## Organization
Acts 29 Church for the Unsheltered is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

## Mission
At its core, Acts 29 exists to provide both spiritual and basic life essentials to individuals experiencing homelessness. We accomplish this by hosting church services at three locations in Springfield and one location in Jacksonville.

## Spiritual Essentials

The vast majority of individuals experiencing homelessness have endured significant trauma at some point in their lives—often mental, physical, sexual, or emotional abuse. The cumulative impact of this trauma frequently results in a deeply broken sense of identity. Proverbs 23:7 reminds us, "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he." One's identity profoundly shapes life choices and behaviors. When that identity has been shattered by abuse and feelings of worthlessness, it often manifests in self-destructive decisions and, in many cases, substance addiction.

During our services, we share gospel-centered messages focused on restoring identity through biblical truth and offer opportunities for individual prayer. We consistently communicate that God created each person on purpose and for a purpose, that they are deeply loved and forgiven, and that God desires a relationship with them regardless of their past or present circumstances. Our volunteers also demonstrate Christ's love by offering prayer, encouragement, and Christ-centered relationships.

## Basic Life Essentials

Our ministry also addresses practical needs. We believe love is best expressed through action.

### Meals
At each of our services in Springfield and Jacksonville, we serve a hot meal. Additionally, we partner with My Brother's Keeper to provide food directly to individuals living on the streets of Springfield from April through November. Food meets a basic need and often serves as a bridge to deeper ministry engagement.

### Clothing
We provide clothing at our church services. Guests are welcome to select items from a free clothing table, and we also accept individual clothing requests. These requests are fulfilled and distributed as personalized clothing care packages during our services.

## Ways to Get Involved

### Prayer
We covet prayer for God's provision, protection, and continued guidance.

### Clothing Donations
Most congregants have gently used clothing they no longer wear, which can greatly benefit those we serve.

### Food Donations
We provide approximately 6,500 meals annually. Our largest expenses include protein, serving containers, and carbohydrates. Donations in these areas are always appreciated.

### Volunteer Time
Volunteers are vital to our ministry. We welcome individuals who desire to serve and demonstrate God's grace and mercy in practical ways.

### Financial Support
While our ministry operates without payroll or owned assets, financial support is necessary to sustain our outreach. All funds received are used directly to support the unsheltered.

## Key Statistics
- 4 church service locations (3 in Springfield, 1 in Jacksonville)
- Approximately 6,500 meals served annually
- Street outreach from April through November (partnership with My Brother's Keeper)
- 100% of funds go directly to supporting the unsheltered (no payroll or owned assets)
